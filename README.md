Description:
This Google Cardboard virtual reality game runs on Android devices running Android 4.4 or higher. The player can play three different carnival games: "Wheel of Fortune", "Coin Toss", and "Plinko." As the player plays the different games, they are awarded points which accumulate per game and are displayed on the in-world Scoreboard. Once the player accumulates 200 points in any game they are awarded a digital Teddy Bear, which spawns above and in front of the scoreboard and drops to the ground.

Game Instructions:
-"Wheel of Fortune"
The player gazes at the Wheel and presses the Google Cardboard button (or taps on the screen/uses bluetooth keyboard controller). The wheel spins and randomly stops on a wheel segment to earn points.

-"Coin Toss"
The player gazes at the pile of coins on the ground, then presses the Google Cardboard button (or taps on the screen/uses bluetooth keyboard controller) to select a coin. The "Power" meter will then oscillate between high and low power. The player then presses the Google Cardboard button (or taps on the screen/uses bluetooth keyboard controller) again to toss the coin. If the coin lands above the line and in the scoring area, they are awarded points.

-"Plinko"
The coin will oscillate left and right across the top of the Plinko board until the player presses the Google Cardboard button (or taps on the screen/uses bluetooth keyboard controller) to drop the coin. The coin then bounces between the Plinko pegs and falls into the different scoring areas at the bottom.
